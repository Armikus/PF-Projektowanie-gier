\section{Project Description}
\section{Story}
The confused player wakes up in the deepest section of mysterious, filled with hatred, dungeon. A player during the game progression tries to find a reason why they got there and what’s most important how to get out. During various encounters there will be a possibility to find a note with useful lore, gradually bringing the player closer to finding the truth about the world they are now part of.
\subsection{Theme}
The game will be made in a dark fantasy theme. The player will be put in the world filled with pain, suffering and depression.
\section{Gameplay}
\subsection{Goal}
The gameplay is divided into two main phases: combat and explore phase. Explore phase is simple 2d, tile-based dungeon crawler, during this simple activity player will have the possibility to encounter the enemy which will switch the user into combat phase. During the combat phase, the objective is to kill all the enemies. After defeating an opponent player will come back to explore phase.
\subsection{Game Mechanics}
\subsubsection{Explore Phase}
\begin{itemize}
\item The player will be exploring the various places in the dungeon, with the possibility of finding hidden relics and lore notes that can help with defeating the last boss.
\item The dungeon is divided into different floors that which has a different guardian that needs to be defeated.
\item During exploring there will be a chance for the random enemy encounter, which leads to the combat phase.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Combat Phase}
\begin{itemize}
\item The main goal of the combat phase is to defeat all the enemies, which means getting their HP to 0 or below. When a player wins, they will get rewards, which can be exp points, in-game currency, lore note or special item.
\item The fight is divided into turns, the player and an enemy turns will be taking place one after another, who will get first turn will be decided randomly.
\item During turns itself, the player will get a “hand” of cards, which will represent his possible moves. Cards can be divided into offensive and defensive ones. 
\item For each turn, the player will get 3 stamina points which will be consumed with every used card.
\item If player’s HP goes to 0 or below he will die and lose the game, albeit once per fight there is a really small possibility for the player to be saved from death by ancient gods.
\item The saved player will be left on ¼ of his hp and will have to recover full hp to be able to get the blessing again.
\item Winning fight automatically brings the player back to the exploring phase.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Items \&  Powerups}
The player can obtain various relics that can boost their statistics and gain them some special effects, but everything will come with a certain price. Moreover after getting enough exp player will level up which means increasing their maximum health, also on every level up player can choose one of 3 new move cards that will be added to his deck.
\subsection{Losing}
If the player will lose any combat phase he will die permanently, which means completely losing the game and all its progress.
